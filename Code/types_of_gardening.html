<center><h2><u>Flower Gardens</u></h2></center>

<br/>


<center><p class="s1">

	Though flower gardens in different countries may vary in the types of plants that are grown, the basic planning
       and principles are nearly the same, whether the gardens are formal or informal. Trees and shrubsare the mainstay of
      a well-designed flower garden. These permanent features are usually planned first, and the spaces for herbaceous plant
     s, annuals and bulbs are arranged around them. The range of flowering trees and shrubs is enormous. It is important, how-
    ever, that such plants be appropriate to areas they will occupy when mature. Thus it is oflittle use to plant a forest tree
   that will grow 100 feet (30 metres) high and 50 feet across in a small suburban front garden 30 feet square. but a narrow flow
       ering cherry or redbud tree would be quite suitable. Blending and contrast of colour as well as of forms are important aspects 
        consider in planning a garden. The older type of herbaceous border was designed to give a maximum display of colour in summer,
          but manys.rdeners now prefer to have flowers during the early spring as well, at the expense of some bare patches later.
            This is often done by planting early-flowering bulbs in groups toward the front. Mixed borders of flowering shrubs
              combined with herbaceous plants are also popular and do not require quite so much maintenance as the complet-
                 ely herbaceous border.

<center><h2><u>Rock Gardens</u></h2></center>
<br/>


<center><p class="s1">

	Rock gardens are designed to look as if they are a natural part of a rocky hillside or slope. If rocks are
       added, they are generally laid on their larger edges, as in natural strata. A few large boulders usually look
      better than a number of small rocks. In a well-designed rock garden, rocks are arranged so that there are various
     exposures for sun-tolerant plants such as rockroses and for shade-tolerant plants such as primulas, which often do be
     tter in a cool, north-facing aspect. Many smaller perennial plants are available for filling spaces in vertical cracks
      among the rock faces.The main rocks from which rock gardens are constructed are sandstone and limestone. Sandstone, l
       ess irregular and pitted generally, looks more restful and natural, but certain plants, notably most of the dianthu
        ses, do best in limestone. Granite is generally regarded as too hard and unsuitable for the rock garden because 
	    it weathers very slowly.</p></center>

<center><h2><u>Woodland Gardens</u></h2></center>
<br/>




<center><p class="s1">

      The informal woodland garden is the natural descendant of the shrubby “wilderness” of earlier times. The essence of the
      woodland garden is informality and naturalness. Paths curve rather than run straight and are of mulch or grass rather 
      than pavement. Trees are thinned to allow enough light, particularly in the glades, but irregular groups may be left, and
      any mature tree of character can be a focal point. Plants are chosen largely from those that are woodlanders in their nat-
      ive countries: rhododendron, magnolia,pieris, and maple among the trees and shrubs; lily, daffodil, and snowdrop among the
        bulbs; primrose, hellebore, St.-John’s-wort, epimedium, and many others among the herbs.

<center><h2><u>Water Gardens</u></h2></center>
<br/>




<center><p class="s1">

	      The water garden represents one of the oldest forms of gardening. Egyptian records and pictures of cultivated water
             lilies date as far back as 2000 BCE. The Japanese have also made water gardens to their own particular and beautiful p-
            atterns for many centuries. Many have an ornamental lantern of stone in the centre or perhaps a flat trellis roof of wiste-
           ria extending over the water. In Europe and North America, water gardens range from formal pools with rectangular or circular 
          outline, sometimes with fountains in the centre and often without plants or with just one or two water lilies (Nymphaea), to inf-
         ormal pools of irregular outline planted with water lilies and other water plants and surrounded by boggy or damp soil where mois-
         ture-tolerant plants can be grown. The pool must contain suitable oxygenating plants to keep the water clear and support any intro-
          duced fish. Most water plants, including even the large water lilies, do well in still water two to five feet deep.Temperate w-
           ater lilies flower all day, but many of the tropical and subtropical ones open their flowers only in the evening. In tempera-
            te countries water gardens also can be made under glass, and the pools can be kept heated. In such cases, more tropical p
             lants, such as the great Victoria amazonica (V. regia) or the lotus (Nelumbo nucifera), can be grown together with p-
              apyrus reeds at the edge. The range of moisture-loving plants for damp places at the edge of the pool is great a-
               nd includes many beautiful plants such as the candelabra primulas, calthas, irises, and osmunda ferns.

<center><h2><u>Herb and Vegetable Gardens</u></h2></center>
<br/>




<center><p class="s1">

	Most of the medieval gardens and the first botanical gardens were largely herb gardens containing plants used for medicinal
       purposes or herbs such as thyme, parsley, rosemary, fennel, marjoram, and dill for savouring foods. The term herb garden is u-
      sually used now to denote a garden of herbs used for cooking, and the medicinal aspect is rarely considered. Herb gardens need a
     sunny position, because the majority of the plants grown are native to warm, dry regions.The vegetable garden also requires an open
    and sunny location. Good cultivation and preparation of the ground are important for successful vegetable growing, and it is also desi-
     rable to practice a rotation of crops as in farming. The usual period of rotation for vegetables is three years; this also helps to
      prevent the carryover from season to season of certain pests and diseases.The old French potager, the prized vegetable garden, w-
       as grown to be decorative as well as useful; the short rows with little hedges around and the high standard of cultivation r-
        epresent a model of the art of vegetable growing. The elaborate parterre vegetable garden at the Château de Villandry is p-
           erhaps the finest example in Europe of a decorative vegetable garden.

<center><h2><u>Roof Gardens</u></h2></center>
<br/>




<center><p class="s1">

The modern tendency in architecture for flat roofs has made possible the development of attractive roof gardens in urban areas
above private houses and commercial buildings. These gardens follow the same principles as others except that the depth of soil
is less, to keep the weight on the rooftop low, and therefore the size of plants is limited. The plants are generally set in t-
ubs or other containers, but elaborate roof gardens have been made with small pools and beds. Beds of flowering plants are suit
  able, among which may be stood tubs of specimen plants to produce a desired effect.

<center><h2><u>Scented Gardens</u></h2></center>
<br/>




<center><p class="s1">

Scent is one of the qualities that many people appreciate highly in gardens. Scented gardens, in which scent from leaves or flo-
wers is the main criterion for inclusion of a plant, have been established, especially for the benefit of blind people. Some pl-
ants release a strong scent in full sunlight, and many must be bruised or rubbed to yield their fragrance. These are usually gr-
   own in raised beds within easy reach of visitors.
